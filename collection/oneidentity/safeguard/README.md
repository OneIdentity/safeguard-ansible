# Safeguard Collection

## What is the Safeguard collection?

The Safeguard collection provides plugins that can be used to integrate Safeguard for Privileged Passwords (SPP) with Ansible. These plugins allow an Ansible playbook or other templates to pull credentials directly from SPP so that they can be used by Ansible to perform tasks. This collection provides a lookup plugin which is capabile of fetching a credential from SPP given an A2A registration with the corresponding API key. For more information about SPP and A2A registrations, please see the administration guide for your SPP appliance.
